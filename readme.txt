Known Bugs (troubleshooting):
-----------------------------

	*All textures do not load properly, on some machines
		-VRML has very limited texture memory.  This usually happens when
		 either using IE, or not enough RAM.  Maybe we'll try to work on
		 it if enough people complain.

	*The game freezes occasionally when attempting to play a sound effect
		-We think this is problem with CosmoPlayer, since it is very
		 inconsistent.

	*Pacman sometimes misses pellets, especially going around corners
		-Sorry.  Again, if someone actually cares, we might work on it.


Production de la:
-----------------
        Some members of UCF's VRT/Toyscouts circa 04/22/1999

        Mike Barnoske
        Joe Del Rocco
        Kevin Erfani
        Syrus Mesdaghi

        At the time, they referred to themselves as ficticious company RPG.
        All of those members are still programmers today.
